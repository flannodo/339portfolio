          Reminder to purchase your tickets and RSVP as early as possible but NO LATER than March 1st!
          This is typically a sold out event with more than 450 parents, friends and supporters in attendance,
          and we have limited seating available in the gymnasium. First come, first serve and
          NO tickets will be sold at the door! </p>

        <p id="announcements3">Attention Senior Girls: Be sure to be checking your emails for your dress fitting time and
          location! It is so important that you show up to your assigned boutique on time and with a
          cooperative and excited attitude! These stores have been so generous with their time and with
          their dresses!</p>
