    <p id='about1'>
      Hi! My name is Megan O'Donnell and I am proud to be the Chair of the Notre Dame High School Senior Fashion Show. The Notre Dame High School Senior Fashion Show Committee is hosting its 13th
      Annual Fashion Show on Wednesday, March 18, 2020 and this will be my 6th consecutive year as the Chairperson of this special event!
    </p>

    <br>
    <p id='about2'> My husband and I are both alumni of Notre Dame High School as are my three oldest children. My youngest daughter is currently a senior, and this will be my final year running the Senior
      Fashion Show. As a parent, I know first hand how special these types of events are, and my biggest goal is to make this a special night for all parents with a senior in this year's
      graduating class. I also love having the opportunity to work with so many of these parents on my Fashion Show Committee Team.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p id='about3'>Proceeds from the Senior Fashion Show are used exclusively to fund Notre Dameâ€™s Post Prom celebration, which provides our seniors with an all-night, adult-supervised party free of alcohol
      and drugs. This after prom party offers seniors the opportunity to enjoy music, food, games, and prizes with their friends and eliminates many of the risks often associated with post prom parties.
